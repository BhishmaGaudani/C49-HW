        <h1>how to make oragimi bird</h1>
 <img src= "step1.jpg" > <h3> Step 1: Start with a square piece of origami paper. If you only have regular 8.5x11 paper, follow these instructions to make a square sheet. You can also use these colorful Printable Origami Paper. </h3>
  <img src= "step2.jpg" > <h3> Step 2: Fold the paper in half by folding the top corner to the bottom corner. You should have an upside down triangle. </h3>
  <img src= "step3.jpg" > <h3> Step 3: Fold part of the top down so that the edge is about halfway down. Don't make this flap too thin because this will become the wings. </h3>
  <img src= "step 4.jpg" >  <h3>Step 4: Turn the paper over. </h3>
  <img src= "step5.jpg" >  <h3>Step 5: Take the bottom corner of the top layer and fold it up like this. </h3>
  <img src= "step6.jpg" >  <h3>Step 6: Fold the figure in half by folding the left side over to the right. </h3>
  <img src= "step7.jpg" >  <h3>Step 7: Now fold that same flap back like this to make one of the wings. </h3>
  <img src= "step8.jpg" > <h3> Step 8: Fold the other wing back also. </h3>
 <img src= "step9.jpg">   <h3>Step 9: Push the center of the head in and flatten. This is called an inside reverse fold. </h3>
 <img src= "step10.jpg" >   <h3>Step 10: And tada! You have yourself a bird. Now set it free! Just kidding. Don't throw it in the air. It will just fall down and you'll be disappointed. </h3>
